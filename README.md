# Heart_Disease_Analysis
## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early detection and understanding of risk factors critical for preventative healthcare. This project aims to analyze a heart disease dataset to identify key health metrics and demographic factors that influence the likelihood of heart disease. By examining relationships between variables such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and chest pain types, we seek to uncover patterns and correlations that can help predict heart disease risk. Using visualizations and statistical analysis, this project will explore trends within the data, detect anomalies, and compare distributions among individuals with and without heart disease. Ultimately, these insights can contribute to better risk stratification and support healthcare providers in identifying high-risk individuals, potentially guiding interventions for those most vulnerable.
